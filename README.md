## üîÑ Request Flow

React Component (User Action)  
   ‚≠¢ Axios Service (API Call)  
   ‚≠¢ HTTP Request (with JWT Cookie)  
   ‚≠¢ Express Route Handler  
   ‚≠¢ Auth Middleware (JWT Verification)  
   ‚≠¢ Controller (Business Logic)  
   ‚≠¢ Model (Database Query)  
   ‚≠¢ PostgreSQL Database  
   ‚≠¢ JSON Response  
   ‚≠¢ React State Update & UI Render

### Layer Responsibilities

| Layer | Technology | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Presentation** | React Components | UI rendering, user interactions, form validation |
| **State Management** | Context API | Global auth state, user data |
| **API Client** | Axios | HTTP requests, error handling |
| **Routes** | Express Router | URL mapping, middleware application |
| **Middleware** | Custom Functions | Authentication, authorization, CORS |
| **Controllers** | Business Logic | Request validation, response formatting |
| **Models** | Database Queries | Data access, SQL queries |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL | Data persistence, transactions |

üéØ Key Design Decisions
-----------------------

**1\. JWT with HTTP-only Cookies** Prevents XSS attacks, provides stateless auth, 7-day expiration balances security & UX

**2\. PostgreSQL Database** ACID compliance, complex relationships support, excellent performance with indexing, transaction support

**3\. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** Two roles (student/admin) with middleware enforcement, admin key prevents unauthorized access

**4\. Two-Step Submission Verification** Checkbox confirmation prevents accidental submissions, ensures user intent

**5\. Self-Service Group Management** Students create groups autonomously, group creator becomes leader with management permissions

**6\. RESTful API Design** Predictable URL structure, HTTP verbs match operations, consistent response format

**7\. Component-Based Frontend** Reusable components (Button, Card, Modal), Context API for global state, no over-engineering

**8\. Database Indexing** Indexes on foreign keys and frequently queried columns (email, due_date) for 10-20x performance

### Deployment Strategy

| Component | Recommended Platform | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Frontend** | Vercel / Netlify | Zero-config deployment, CDN, auto-scaling |
| **Backend** | Railway / Heroku | Easy PostgreSQL integration, environment variables |
| **Database** | Railway / AWS RDS | Managed PostgreSQL, automated backups |
